            <p>React is a javascript library use for user interfaces, React is one of the fastes libaries used for development execute and run code in a better scalete way.<br></br>

            React is a javascript library used to build faster interactive users interfaces for the web as well as mobile aplications. Some thing that makes react really  powefull it’s that react is an open source base on front-end library, so any user can acces to source code modify it an enhance it.<br></br>

            The way you can build in react is by compinent due to React is a component-based. You could build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex Uis.</p>

            <h2>React features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Virtual DOM</li>
                <p>DOM is an object-base representation of a document load on a browser, however react has a virtual DOM who helps to speed up the app, it desn’t write to the screen so that is a strategy to prevent draw unnecesary  page elements during re-render.</p>

                <li>JSX</li>
                <p>JSX is an extention of javascript so it can process some things that are not normally part of the sintaxis of javascript, it is a easy way to write HTML and Javascritp together wich provide a way to structure component rendering using syntax that are more familiar for some developers.</p>

                <li>React Native</li>
                <p>React it’s a greate library to build not only websites but also iOS or Android  Apps, thats why react has it’s own library to buils those Apps that it is call React Native.</p>

                <li>Declarative UI</li>
                <p>React has the declarative paradigm programint that you just need to describe what does the app need to do whitout explicity specifying its control flow</p>

                <li>hooks</li>
                <p>hooks are an API that allows us to use the state and some other features stateful logic without changing components hierarchy.</p>
            </ul>

            <h3>What is react hooks</h3>

            <p>Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components. Hooks don’t work inside classes — they let you use React without classes. (We don’t recommend rewriting your existing components overnight but you can start using Hooks in the new ones if you’d like.)<br></br>

            React provides a few built-in Hooks like useState. You can also create your own Hooks to reuse stateful behavior between different components. We’ll look at the built-in Hooks first.</p>

            <h2>Advantages and disadvantages from react</h2>
            <p>To start this are no the sentences that i belive on but they are the ones who repeat constantly when i was searching about, therefore, i’mstarting learnign this new library so then i can confirm them if they were rigth.</p>

                    <li>Creating Dynamic Web Applications Becomes Easier</li>
                    <li>Reusable Components</li>
                    <li>Performance Enhancement</li>
                    <li>The Support of react developer tools</li>
                    <li>SEO Friendly</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Disadvantage of ReactJS</h3>

                    <li>The high pace of development</li>
                    <li>Poor Documentation</li>
                    <li>Developmetn speed</li>

            <h2>why i choosed learn React</h2>
            <p>I started to build web aplication with contents management sistems like wordpress, so when i was working in a marketing agenci a web developer i realize that the powerfull of those CMS’s (content management sistem) was so tight, then i was loking for learnd some libary o framework because i already knew HTML, CSS and the basic of javascrip, as result i started to inform my self for the options that i could learnd, soon i found react,i started reed some information about it, there was when i realize that this library has potencial as well as a good oprtuniti to lear something  that colud give me a better job due to i reacognize that hass many job vacancies.<br></br>

            If i could list the things that i considered are the best to prefer react as front-end responsive user interfaces were the next:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reusable components</li>
                <li>asy coding</li>
                <li>Simple to scale</li>
                <li>Dinamic webs</li>
                <li>Greate community</li>
                <li>Flex coding with hooks</li>
            </ul>
